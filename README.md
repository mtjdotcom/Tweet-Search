# Tweet-Search
This is a repository for a coding challenge. The challenge involved finding duplicate twitter users in a series of tweets. 
Please note, this is not an optimal solution to the problem. This algorithm should only be used on n < 1,000,000 tweets. 
An optimal solution should involve using storage and or breaking the gzip into a subset of files. 
This project helped me learn about BigO notation, performance testing, and other data engineering fundamentals.
